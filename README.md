# FinalProject-Group2-TechDominators-FacialRecognitionApp

Insecurity in these times has skyrocketed and schools are looking for ways to reinforce the security system of their school to keep the fears of worrying parents at bay. We're building a facial recognition application for schools and parents so that the school management  can be able to keep track of who came to pick the students and when they're picked. This can help to manage the issue of just anyone picking the kids without proper registration with the school management thus strengthening the security system of the school.
